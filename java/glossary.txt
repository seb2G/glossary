- Two's complement - the way each computer calculates the negative integer, e.g. calculate -28 from 28. The number will be written in binary, next each bit will be inverted. After that you will add one to the result
e.g. 28 can be represented as 00011100 > after inverting the bits 11100011 > after adding one to the result 11100100
- Unsigned vs signed - unsigned used the leading bit as a part of the value, whilst the signed version uses the left most bit to identify if the number is positive or negative
